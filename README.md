# Project Description

This project includes a template for creating a web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also includes code examples for pulling and displaying data from an API using the Axios library.

# How does it work

This project uses a simple structure of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. The index.html file is used to display the page. The style.css file determines the style of the page. The script.js file provides the functionality of the page.

On the page, the user needs to enter the name of the Github user they want to search. Once the username is entered, requests are sent to Github REST APIs using the Axios library, and the user's information, repositories, and profile picture are displayed on the page. In addition, the repository name, description and README file link of the repository are also listed for each repository.
